#+STARTUP: showall

* effective-chargen

A Clojure library that generically models characters, either NPCs or PCs, and
the more common operations performed with and upon them.

** Usage

Leiningen dependency:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;; TODO: Will publish to Clojars once reasonably usable.
#+END_SRC

In code:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;; TODO: Examples forthcoming, once API is stabilized.
#+END_SRC

** Details

A common (though not universal) weak point in games, particularly RPGs, is the
depth of character mechanics.  This library is an attempt to focus on what it
would take to deeply model characters, determine what should and shouldn't be
included, and serve as a test bed for some experimental ideas that have not yet
been attempted.

Some principle goals of the library:

- Exposure of a generic API and data structures for character modeling.
  "Generic" here means the model can be applied in a variety of genres, or even
  in non-game applications.  When in conflict with utility or usability,
  however, it will default to applicability within RNG-based RPGs.
- Machine generation of deeply modeled characters, with internal consistency
  between traits and trait groups.  This will result in believable characters,
  of a quality level typically requiring manual creation.
- A functional, data-centric approach, where the using application has a lot of
  freedom to create wrapping facades, selectively ignore features, and replace
  provided functions.

Sub-components will include:

- Extremely detailed character meta-information.
- A health and damage model, to the level of individual main body parts.
- A global and local status model.
- Inventory and equipped item slots.

Some ancillary/personal goals:

- I'm using this project as a test case for self-education on idiomatic use of
  core.spec.
- This library is being made with an eye towards a couple future games I might
  write in Clojure.  If successful, other mechanics/modeling libraries may
  materialize.
